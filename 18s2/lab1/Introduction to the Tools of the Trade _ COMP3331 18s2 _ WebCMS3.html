  <b>
   NOTE: This is not a lab exercise. Rather this is reference guide to various tools that will be used in the lab exercises.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>
   Attention:
  </strong>
  The descriptions of the commands in here are not complete. This 
document is given as a guideline and may be used as quick reference. To 
obtain more information about the capabilities and the syntax of these 
commands take a look at the man pages or simply use
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">
   Wikipedia
  </a>
  or
  <a href="http://www.google.com.au/">
   Google
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>
   Remark:
  </em>
  Certain tools can be found in following directories: /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin.
 </p>
 <h3>
  ping
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   ping
  </b>
  utility is used to check connectivity to a host (to check if a host 
operating and network connections are intact). A small packet is sent 
through the network to a particular IP address. This packet contains 64 
bytes - 56 data bytes and 8 bytes of protocol header information. The 
host that sent the packet then waits (or 'listens') for a return packet.
 If the connections are good and the target host is up, a good return 
packet will be received. The
  <b>
   ping
  </b>
  can also measure the round trip time of a packet. We use the following forms of the command:
 </p>
 <pre>$ ping host</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  It gives only the answer if the connectivity to the host is OK or not.
 </p>
 <pre>$ ping -s packetsize host </pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Option -s
  <i>
   packetsize
  </i>
  specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56.
 </p>
 <pre>$ ping -i interval host </pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Option -i
  <i>
   interval
  </i>
  specifies the interval between sending ping requests. The default is one second.
 </p>
 <h3>
  traceroute
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   traceroute
  </b>
  utility traces the route that an IP packet follows from your host to 
another Internet host. It shows how a host is physically connected to 
the Internet. Along the way it gives an understanding of how networks 
inter-connect. This network utility can also measure the round trip time
 between your host and the intermediate routers along the path.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The traceroute command is used to discover the routes that packets 
actually take when traveling to their destination. The device (for 
example, a router or a PC) sends out a sequence of User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP) datagrams to an invalid port address at the remote host. 
The default IP probe packet which encapsulates the UDP datagram is 40 
bytes.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Three UDP datagrams are sent, each with a Time-To-Live (TTL) field 
value set to one. The TTL value of 1 causes the datagram to "timeout" as
 soon as it hits the first router in the path; this router then responds
 with an ICMP Time Exceeded Message (TEM) indicating that the datagram 
has expired.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Another three UDP messages are now sent, each with the TTL value set 
to 2, which causes the second router to return ICMP TEMs. This process 
continues until the packets actually reach the destination. Since these 
datagrams are trying to access an invalid port at the destination host, 
ICMP Port Unreachable Messages are returned, indicating an unreachable 
port; this event signals the Traceroute program that it is finished.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The purpose behind this is to record the source of each ICMP Time 
Exceeded Message to provide a trace of the path the packet took to reach
 the destination.
 </p>
 <pre>$ traceroute host</pre>
 <h3>
  telnet (obsolete)
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   telnet
  </b>
  utility is used to connect from one host to another (remote login) via
 the internet network. This command allows you to log onto machines 
around the world that you have accounts on or that allow public access. 
The most common way to use the command is:
 </p>
 <pre>$ telnet host [port]</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  port indicates a port number (address of an application); if it is not specified, than the default telnet port is used.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  After issuing the
  <b>
   telnet
  </b>
  command, you will be presented with a login prompt for the host 
system. You may now login to the host system. When you are finished with
 your remote session, logout as usual.
 </p>
 <h3>
  ssh
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  SSH is a set of standards and an associated network protocol that 
allows establishing a secure channel between a local and a remote 
computer. The SSH client -
  <b>
   ssh
  </b>
  - that supports terminal protocols is typically used for remote 
administration of the SSH server computer via terminal console, thus it 
is used as an alternative to
  <b>
   telnet
  </b>
  . The most common way to use the command is:
 </p>
 <pre>$ ssh -l username hostname</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <i>
  </i>
  or
 </p>
 <pre>$ ssh username@hostname</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  After issuing the
  <b>
   ssh
  </b>
  command, if the remote computer authenticates you successfully, you 
will be presented with a login prompt for the remote machine. You may 
now login to the host system. When you are finished with your remote 
session, logout as usual.
 </p>
 <h3>
  ifconfig
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   ifconfig
  </b>
  utility is used to assign an address to a network interface and to 
configure or display the current network interface configuration 
information. It must be used at system startup to define the network 
address of each interface present on a machine. After system startup, it
 can also be used to redefine an interface's address and its other 
operating parameters. If a single interface argument is given, it 
displays the status of the given interface only; if a single -a argument
 is given, it displays the status of all interfaces. Otherwise, it 
configures an interface.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Note: the directory /sbin is not the path of a typical user. So you may have to type /sbin/ifconfig
 </p>
 <h3>
  netstat
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   netstat
  </b>
  utility allows to print the various data related to the network 
configuration of a station. Here, we show only two forms of this 
command:
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Option -i allows to print the state of the network interfaces (e.g. eth0 or lo).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The MTU and Met fields show the current MTU and metric values for that
 interface. The RX and TX columns show how many packets have been 
received or transmitted error-free (RX-OK/TX-OK) or damaged 
(RX-ERR/TX-ERR); how many were dropped (RX-DRP/TX-DRP); and how many 
were lost because of an overrun (RX-OVR/TX-OVR).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The last column shows the flags that have been set for this interface.
 These characters are one-character versions of the long flag names that
 are printed when you display the interface configuration with
  <b>
   ifconfig
  </b>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   B - A broadcast address has been set
  </li>
  <li>
   L - This interface is a loopback device
  </li>
  <li>
   M - All packets are received (promiscuous mode)
  </li>
  <li>
   O - ARP is turned off for this interface
  </li>
  <li>
   P - This is a point-to-point connection
  </li>
  <li>
   R - Interface is running
  </li>
  <li>
   U - Interface is up
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  When you invoke
  <b>
   netstat
  </b>
  with the -r flag, it displays the kernel routing table. The -n option makes
  <b>
   netstat
  </b>
  print addresses as dotted quad IP numbers rather than the symbolic 
host and network names. This option is especially useful when you want 
to avoid address lookups over the network (e.g., to a DNS or NIS 
server).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The second column of
  <b>
   netstat
  </b>
  's output shows the gateway to which the routing entry points. If no 
gateway is used, an asterisk is printed instead. The third column shows 
the "generality" of the route, i.e., the network mask for this route. 
The fourth column displays the following flags that describe the route:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   G - The route uses a gateway
  </li>
  <li>
   U - The interface to be used is up
  </li>
  <li>
   H - Only a single host can be reached through the route
  </li>
  <li>
   D - This route is dynamically created. It is set if the table entry 
has been generated by a routing daemon like gated or by an ICMP redirect
 message
  </li>
  <li>
   M - This route is set if the table entry was modified by an ICMP redirect message
  </li>
  <li>
   ! - The route is a reject route and datagrams will be dropped
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>
  netperf
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   netperf
  </b>
  utility provides tests for both unidirectional throughput and 
end-to-end latency. The calculation of these parameters is based on 
measuring the time necessary to transmit messages of fixed size by TCP.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The most common use of
  <b>
   netperf
  </b>
  is measuring bulk data transfer performance. This is also referred to 
as "stream" or "unidirectional stream" performance. Essentially, these 
tests will measure how fast one system can send data to another and/or 
how fast that other system can receive it. Request/response performance 
is the second area that can be investigated with
  <b>
   netperf
  </b>
  . Generally speaking,
  <b>
   netperf
  </b>
  request/response performance is quoted as "transactions/s" for a given
 request and response size. A transaction is defined as the exchange of a
 single request and a single response. From a transaction rate, one can 
infer one way and round-trip average latency.
 </p>
 <pre>$ netperf host [message_size [count]]</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The obligatorily parameter is the name or address of a destination 
towards which we want to measure the performance. The optional 
parameters are the size of the messages (in Bytes, by default 1024) and 
the number of messages to be sent (if the latter is not specified, 
netperf sends messages until you stop it by Ctrl-C).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>
   netperf
  </b>
  prints a statistics report regularly (approximately every second) in a table of 5 columns with the following heading:
 </p>
 <pre>Total Delta | Avg 1 Avg 10 Avg (kbits/s)

</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  "Total" is the total number of messages sent since the launching of 
netperf; "Delta" is the number of messages sent since the preceding 
report/ratio; "Avg 1" is the average throughput since the preceding 
report; "Avg 10" is the average throughput during the last 10 reports; 
"Avg" is the average throughput since the launching of netperf. All the 
throughputs are expressed in Kbit/s.

 </p>
 <h3>
  nslookup, dig, host
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   nslookup
  </b>
  utility is used to find out the corresponding IP address of a host 
name (e.g., "whatis.com") by contacting Internet Domain Name Servers. It
 also does reverse name lookup and find the host name for a specified IP
 address. It has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive
 mode is used to get information about various hosts and domains or to 
displays a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to 
display just the name and requested information for a host or domain.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Non-interactive mode:
 </p>
 <pre>$ nslookup host</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Interactive mode:
 </p>
 <pre>$ nslookup
&gt; server ns1.nic.fr
&gt; set q=NS
&gt; imag.fr.
Server: ns1.nic.fr
Address: 192.93.0.1
Non-authoritative answer:
imag.fr nameserver = dns.inria.fr
imag.fr nameserver = imag.imag.fr
imag.fr nameserver = isis.imag.fr
imag.fr nameserver = ns2.nic.fr
Authoritative answers can be found from:
dns.inria.fr internet address = 193.51.208.13
imag.imag.fr internet address = 129.88.30.1
isis.imag.fr internet address = 129.88.32.24
ns2.nic.fr internet address = 192.93.0.4</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   dig
  </b>
  command is similar to nslookup. It is a tool for querying DNS 
nameservers for information about host addresses, mail exchanges, 
nameservers, and related information. It performs DNS lookups and 
displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were
 queried. As with nslookup, dig provides the possibility of inverse DNS 
queries through when the
  <b>
   -x
  </b>
  option is given.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because 
of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup 
tools tend to have less functionality than dig.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has
 a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A 
brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when 
the
  <b>
   -h
  </b>
  option is given. A further description may be found at the man page or
  <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/dig-command-examples/">
   here
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Below, you may also find a short description of the sections, which are returned by the dig command.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  HEADER: This displays the dig command version number, the global 
options used by the dig command, and few additional header information.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  QUESTION SECTION: This displays the question it asked the DNS. i.e 
This is one's input. If one has given the command dig WEBSITE, dig will 
indicate in this section the WEBSITE (e.g. cnn.com) that we asked for 
along with the type of the query. The default type dig command uses is 
"A record".
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  ANSWER SECTION: This displays the answer it receives from the DNS. i.e
 This is the output. For the default query type, this displays the "A 
record" of the WEBSITE (e.g. cnn.com).
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  AUTHORITY SECTION: This displays the DNS name server that has the 
authority to respond to this query. Basically this displays available 
name servers of the website.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  ADDITIONAL SECTION: This displays the ip address of the name servers 
listed in the AUTHORITY SECTION. Stats section at the bottom displays 
few dig command statistics including how much time it took to execute 
this query.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Another useful command, but with lower functionality of both nslookup and dig is the
  <b>
   host
  </b>
  command. It is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is 
normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no 
arguments or options are given, host prints a short summary of its 
command line arguments and options.
 </p>
 <h3>
  grep
 </h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The
  <b>
   grep
  </b>
  utility searches text files for a pattern and prints all lines that 
contain that pattern. If you want to search for a fixed string you 
should rather use
  <b>
   fgrep
  </b>
  . For example, to find which port protocol SMTP uses type the following:
 </p>
 <pre>$ fgrep smtp /etc/services
smtp 25/tcp mail
ssmtp 465/tcp # SMTP over SSL
</pre>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>
   Wireshark (
   <i>
    formerly known as
   </i>
   Ethereal)
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>
   Wireshark
  </b>
  is a free software protocol analyzer, or packet sniffer application, 
used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol 
development, and education. It has all of the standard features of a 
protocol analyzer. The functionality it provides is very similar to
  <b>
   tcpdump
  </b>
  , but it has a GUI front-end, and many more information sorting and 
filtering options. It allows the user to see all traffic being passed 
over the network by putting the network card into promiscuous mode. 
Moreover, it "understands" the structure of different network protocols 
and thus it's able to display encapsulation and single fields and 
interpret their meaning.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The basic tool for observing the messages exchanged between executing protocol entities is called a
  <b>
   packet sniffer
  </b>
  . As the name suggests, a packet sniffer captures (“sniffs”) messages 
being sent/received from/by your computer; it will also typically store 
and/or display the contents of the various protocol fields in these 
captured messages. A packet sniffer itself is passive. It observes 
messages being sent and received by applications and protocols running 
on your computer, but never sends packets itself. Similarly, received 
packets are never explicitly addressed to the packet sniffer. Instead, a
 packet sniffer receives a copy of packets that are sent/received 
from/by application and protocols executing on your machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="Introduction%20to%20the%20Tools%20of%20the%20Trade%20|%20COMP3331%2018s2%20|%20WebCMS3_files/sniffer.png" style="width: 469px; height: 247.0829268292683px;">
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Figure 1 shows the structure of a packet sniffer. At the right of 
Figure 1 are the protocols (in this case, Internet protocols) and 
applications (such as a web browser or ftp client) that normally run on 
your computer. The packet sniffer, shown within the dashed rectangle in 
Figure 1 is an addition to the usual software in your computer, and 
consists of two parts. The
  <b>
   packet capture library
  </b>
  receives a copy of every link-layer frame that is sent from or 
received by your computer. Recall from the discussion from Section 1.5 
in the textbook (Figure 1.20) that messages exchanged by higher layer 
protocols such as HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, DNS, or IP all are eventually 
encapsulated in link-layer frames that are transmitted over physical 
media such as an Ethernet cable. In Figure 1, the assumed physical media
 is an Ethernet, and so all higher layer protocols are eventually 
encapsulated within an Ethernet frame. Capturing all link-layer frames 
thus gives you all messages sent/received from/by all protocols and 
applications executing in your computer.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The second component of a packet sniffer is the
  <b>
   packet analyzer
  </b>
  , which displays the contents of all fields within a protocol message.
 In order to do so, the packet analyzer must “understand” the structure 
of all messages exchanged by protocols. For example, suppose we are 
interested in displaying the various fields in messages exchanged by the
 HTTP protocol in Figure 1. The packet analyzer understands the format 
of Ethernet frames, and so can identify the IP datagram within an 
Ethernet frame. It also understands the IP datagram format, so that it 
can extract the TCP segment within the IP datagram. Finally, it 
understands the TCP segment structure, so it can extract the HTTP 
message contained in the TCP segment. Finally, it understands the HTTP 
protocol and so, for example, knows that the first bytes of an HTTP 
message will contain the string “GET,” “POST,” or “HEAD,” as shown in 
Figure 2.8 in the text.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  We will be using the Wireshark packet sniffer [
  <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">
   http://www.wireshark.org
  </a>
  ] for these labs, allowing us to display the contents of messages 
being sent/received from/by protocols at different levels of the 
protocol stack. (Technically speaking, Wireshark is a packet analyzer 
that uses a packet capture library in your computer). Wireshark is a 
free network protocol analyzer that runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac
 computers. It’s an ideal packet analyzer for our labs – it is stable, 
has a large user base and well-documented support that includes a
  <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/">
   user-guide
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/">
   man pages
  </a>
  , and a detailed
  <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/faq.html">
   FAQ
  </a>
  , rich functionality that includes the capability to analyze more than
 500 protocols, and a well-designed user interface. It operates in 
computers using Ethernet, Token-Ring, FDDI, serial (PPP and SLIP), 
802.11 wireless LANs and ATM connections (if the OS on which it’s 
running allows Wireshark to do so). Wireshark was previously known as 
“Ethereal”.
 </p>
 <h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Running Wireshark
 </h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <img src="Introduction%20to%20the%20Tools%20of%20the%20Trade%20|%20COMP3331%2018s2%20|%20WebCMS3_files/wireshark.png" style="width: 502px; height: 346.2928039702233px;">
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  To run wireshark type “wireshark” at the command prompt (in case there
 is a problem with your path, type /usr/bin/wireshark). When you run the
 Wireshark program, the Wireshark graphical user interface shown in 
Figure 2 will de displayed. Initially, no data will be displayed in the 
various windows. The Wireshark interface has five major components:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The
   <b>
    command menus
   </b>
   are standard pull down menus located at the top of the window. Of 
interest to us now are the File and Capture menus. The File menu allows 
you to save captured packet data or open a file containing previously 
captured packet data, and exit the Wireshark application. The Capture 
menu allows you to begin packet capture.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    The packet-listing window
   </b>
   displays a one-line summary for each packet captured, including the 
packet number (assigned by Wireshark; this is not a packet number 
contained in any protocol’s header), the time at which the packet was 
captured, the packet’s source and destination addresses, the protocol 
type, and protocol-specific information contained in the packet. The 
packet listing can be sorted according to any of these categories by 
clicking on a column name. The protocol type field lists the 
highest-level protocol that sent or received this packet, i.e., the 
protocol that is the source or ultimate sink for this packet.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
   </span>
   The
   <b>
    packet-header details window
   </b>
   provides details about the packet selected (highlighted) in the 
packet-listing window. (To select a packet in the packet-listing window,
 place the cursor over the packet’s one-line summary in the 
packet-listing window and click with the left mouse button.). These 
details include information about the Ethernet frame and IP datagram 
that contains this packet. The amount of Ethernet and IP-layer detail 
displayed can be expanded or minimized by clicking on the right-pointing
 or down-pointing arrowhead to the left of the Ethernet frame or IP 
datagram line in the packet details window. If the packet has been 
carried over TCP or UDP, TCP or UDP details will also be displayed, 
which can similarly be expanded or minimized. Finally, details about the
 highest-level protocol that sent or received this packet are also 
provided.
  </li>
  <li>
   The
   <b>
    packet-contents window
   </b>
   displays the entire contents of the captured frame, in both ASCII and hexadecimal format.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
   </span>
   Towards the top of the Wireshark graphical user interface, is the
   <b>
    packet display filter field
   </b>
   , into which a protocol name or other information can be entered in 
order to filter the information displayed in the packet-listing window 
(and hence the packet-header and packet-contents windows). In the 
example below, we’ll use the packet-display filter field to have 
Wireshark hide (not display) packets except those that correspond to 
HTTP messages.
